# Unity Scripts
This repo's a go to source i'm using for useful and what I can easily predict will be easily reusable C# scripts I've made for Unity Functionality. 

Contains:

# 1) Movement.CS
Used to navigate a 3d VR environment with an XRRIG in a standardized way, with the XRRig containing placement, the camera offset being referred to as the 'head' and the camera itself being regarded as the eyes, this script standardizes that configuration and moves/look for the player on a 2D flat surface accordingly.
